# TUF-on-CI Signer Installation and Configuration

### Requirements

`tuf-on-ci-sign` can be used to sign with either a hardware key with PIV support (e.g.
a Yubikey) or a Sigstore identity.

#### Hardware signing requirements

A hardware signing key must contain a _PIV Digital Signature private key_ to be used with TUF-on-CI.
TUF-on-CI also needs access to a PKCS#11 module.

1. Generate a PIV signing key on your hardware key if you don't have one yet.
   For YubiKey owners, follow the [YubiKey setup instructions](YUBIKEY-PIV-SETUP.md).

1. Install a PKCS#11 module. TUF-on-CI has been tested with the Yubico ykcs11. Debian users can install it with
   ```shell
   $ apt install ykcs11
   ```
   macOS users can install with
   ```shell
   $ brew install yubico-piv-tool
   ```

> **_NOTE:_** Windows WSL users may need to attach a USB hardware device using [usbipd-win](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb)

#### Sigstore signing requirements

:warning: Sigstore signing is an experimental feature and may not be compatible with all TUF client implementations.

To use Sigstore as a signing method, you will need an account in one of the compatible
identity providers (GitHub, Google or Microsoft).

### Signing tool installation

```shell
pip install tuf-on-ci-sign
```

Note: macOS users may have to install swig in case the above wheel build fails

```shell
$ brew install swig
```

### Local configuration

1. `git clone` the repository you are a signer for
1. If you are not a GitHub maintainer of the repository, fork the repository on GitHub
   and add your fork as a remote in your local git clone
1. Create a local configuration file `.tuf-on-ci-sign.ini` in the repository directory
   (either manually or by running the `signer/create-config-file.sh` script included in
   TUF-on-CI sources):

```
[settings]
# Path to PKCS#11 module (optional)
# If not provided, tuf-on-ci-sign will probe some known install locations
# pykcs11lib = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so

# GitHub username
user-name = @my-github-username

# pull-remote: the git remote name of the TUF repository
pull-remote = origin

# push-remote: If you are allowed to push to the TUF repository, you can use the same value
# as pull-remote. Otherwise use the remote name of your fork
push-remote = origin

# base-branch: The base branch name (optional)
# If not provided, tuf-on-ci-sign will auto-detect the default branch or use 'main'
# base-branch = main
```
